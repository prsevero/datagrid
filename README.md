# Datagrid

**First experience with Vue.js framework**

---

## Live demo
The project can be accessed [here](https://prsevero.com.br/datagrid/).

## Project
This project aims to give insights on how to implement a "table with powers" (datagrid/datatable).

Datagrid supports editable fields, sort columns and data search in multiple columns. Additionally, when some action is taken by the user, like sorting a column or editing some field, the data is saved in the server.

As it is my first experience with the VueJS framework, I started with a feature that is usual to every developer: the authentication. I chose to start this way so I could get more comfortable with the framework, and then go to the real deal.

*To do the authentication, you can use any credentials*

## Misc
I spent about 25 hours in the project until now, counting since reading the VueJS docs, the creation of the project, coding the components and deploying it to the server.

The next steps could be improve the tests and it's coverage and make the component more flexibe, so it can be used in different cases, like supporting other types of data than CSV and have some predefined filters, and in the future have the possibility of it be more user customizable.

Also, in this project I was able to use the CSS *sticky* position property, which helped me to do the table headers fixed to the top even when scrolling the page.
